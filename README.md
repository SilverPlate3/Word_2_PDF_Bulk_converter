Today, converting a single Word file into a PDF takes between 10-30 seconds.
So what should we do if we have 100 Word files? Or even more than that.
Well, now you just need to specify the folder that contains the Word files, and the script will do it for you!!!



#Steps
1) Download the .py file
2) Open CMD and run the following command: python <full path of the file>
3) Enter the path of the folder that contains all the Word files
4) Press the button
5) Please be patient while the magic happens.  Converting XML files (Word) into JS and Objects (PDF) takes few seconds.
6) When the GUI window closes, you can close the CMD as well.
